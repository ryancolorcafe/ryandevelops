    I first caught the coding bug in 2014 when I read this <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2014/12/20/370954988/twelve-weeks-to-a-six-figure-job" target="_blank">NPR article</a>. It told the story an English major from UCLA (just like me!) who went into coding and found success. I was intrigued.
  </p>
  <p>
    I then went to a two month bootcamp at Portland Code School to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A <em>lot</em> of <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> lessons and personal learning followed. I decided I needed to take things up a notch.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started the coding bootcamp <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> full-time in January 2016. While there I learned Ember.js, Angular, PHP, Drupal, and how to work well with others as a team. Learning programming full-time for five-plus months made for an amazing immersive experience and I was able to grow my skills immensely in a short amount of time.

  <p>
    My next step was to venture out and find an internship, which I fulfilled at <a href="https://barre3.com" target="_blank">barre3</a>, a boutique fitness brand whose online workout program is streamed around the world. That turned into a full-time job where I spent the next five years helping to double the amount of online subscribers. While mostly in a frontend role there, I also worked a fair amount on the backend with Ruby on Rails and a bit of Java.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the next three years I was a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.fastradius.com/">Fast Radius</a> and <a href="https://www.sybridge.com/">SyBridge Technologies</a> (SyBridge acquired Fast Radius in 2023), which were cloud manufacturing platforms that help engineers design and make commercial grade parts, from drone parts to life-saving medical devices. Starting out I was primarily focused on frontend work with React and TypeScript, but by the end of my tenure I was working full-stack with Elixir and Go. I look to furthering my skills every day, and plan to write about what I learn on <a href="/blog">my blog</a>.

    I'm always looking for new and exciting ventures, or the chance to learn and share knowledge, so feel free to reach out to me on my <a href="/contact">contact page</a>. Thanks for taking a look around!
